# Backup and Disaster Recovery Runbook

This skill provides step-by-step procedures for managing Restic volume snapshots, executing zero-downtime backups, and performing disaster recovery.

## Prerequisites
- Reference [Disaster Recovery and Volume Restoration Reference](./references/restore-runbook.md) for architecture and snapshot pruning details.
- Root or sudo privileges required for backup and restore executions (`sudo ./homelab.sh ...`).

---

## Operations

### Operation 1: Execute Zero-Downtime Volume Backup
Runs online database dumps (PostgreSQL `pg_dumpall`), snapshots `/srv/fast/docker`, archives `.env` secrets, commits git state, and tags the commit:

```bash
sudo ./homelab.sh backup
```

#### Custom Tagging and Commit Messages:
- **CalVer Snapshot** (default):
  ```bash
  sudo ./homelab.sh backup -t calver -m "chore(backup): scheduled volume snapshot"
  ```
- **SemVer Minor Milestone**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./homelab.sh backup -t minor -m "feat(storage): upgraded storage configuration"
  ```
- **Custom Named Snapshot**:
  ```bash
  sudo ./homelab.sh backup -t pre-upgrade -m "chore: snapshot prior to major upgrade"
  ```

---

### Operation 2: Inspect Snapshots
List all historical Restic snapshots with timestamps, snapshot IDs, and paths:

```bash
./homelab.sh snapshots
```

---

### Operation 3: Perform Disaster Recovery (Restore)

#### 1. Dry-Run Verification (Always recommended):
```bash
sudo ./homelab.sh restore latest --dry-run
```

#### 2. Granular Service Restore (Zero disruption to other stacks):
Restore only a specific service data volume:
```bash
sudo ./homelab.sh restore latest <service_name>
```
*Example*: `sudo ./homelab.sh restore latest tandoor`

#### 3. Full Environment Disaster Recovery:
Restore all container data volumes across `${DOCKER_DATA_DIR}`:
```bash
sudo ./homelab.sh restore latest
```
*Note: Full restore creates an emergency safety snapshot, stops all running containers, restores volume directories, repairs ownership (`1000:100`), imports PostgreSQL staging dumps, and brings all stacks back up.*
